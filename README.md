## What is Aviator?

Aviator is a crash game that combines elements of luck and strategy.
Players place bets on a plane that takes off and flies higher and
higher. The longer the plane flies, the higher the multiplier gets, but
the risk of a crash also increases. The goal is to cash out your
winnings before the plane crashes.

## Rules and Strategy

### Rules:

-   Place a bet before the plane takes off.
-   The plane will fly higher and higher, increasing the multiplier.
-   Cash out your winnings at any time before the plane crashes.

### Strategy:

-   Bet small amounts and cash out early for consistent winnings.
-   Look for high multipliers (over x200) and bet larger amounts to
    maximize profits.
-   Use the auto-cash out feature to secure winnings at a predetermined
    multiplier.
